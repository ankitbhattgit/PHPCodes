How to get value of custom codes

$customcode= $cellfeatures=get_post_custom_values('name of custom code');

 

To check whether a user is logged in

is_user_logged_in()





 Display Content Only To Registered Users

To achieve this hack, we'll use a shortcode. The first step is to create it. Open your functions.php file and paste the following code:
function member_check_shortcode($atts, $content = null) {
  if (is_user_logged_in() && !is_null($content) && !is_feed()) {
    return $content;
  } else {
    return 'Sorry, this part is only available to our members. Click here to become a member!';
}

add_shortcode('member', 'member_check_shortcode');


Once that's done, you can add the following to your posts to create a section or text (or any other content) that will be displayed only to registered users:
[member]
This text will be displayed only to registered users.
[/member]
