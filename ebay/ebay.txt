Retrieving and Modifying Data About Sold Items

When an item is sold, Selling Manager generates a sale record. A sale record is displayed in the Sold view in Selling Manager.

The sale record has a sale record ID (also referred to as a sale record number) for each order line item. In the following calls, the value for the sale record ID is in the SellingManagerSalesRecordNumber field: GetOrders, GetOrderTransactions, GetItemTransactions, and GetSellerTransactions.

In the Selling Manager calls, the value for the sale record ID is in the SaleRecordID field.
Retrieving the Data for the Items Sold

Using a time-range or other filter in GetSellingManagerSoldListings, you can get a list of a seller's sold items. This list includes comprehensive information about each item sold.
Retrieving and Revising a Record of Sale

You can use GetSellingManagerSaleRecord to retrieve a detailed, individual sale record for an item that was sold. You can use ReviseSellingManagerSaleRecord to revise many fields of a record, e.g. the pay date, sales tax, and shipping address and date.


 In the API, a Transaction object, including a TransactionID and an OrderLineItemID, is generated by eBay as soon as the buyer commits to a purchase in an eBay listing. The OrderLineItemID value is actually a concatenation of ItemID and TransactionID with a hyphen separating the two values. The OrderLineItemID value is very versatile as it can substitute for any ItemID/TransactionID pair when these values are used as input filters, and its value can be passed into the OrderID field when OrderID is used as an input filter. 

 
	
if the order / checkout is incomplete, you have no access to the shipping address.


OrderID value is created by eBay when the buyer/seller combines multiple line items into one order, and the buyer makes one payment for all line items from the same seller.
